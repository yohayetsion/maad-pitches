> **Related**: [Pitch Deck](index.html) | **Contact**: Wai Chung (Director) - wai@baolondon.com

### The Story
BAO was founded by three art school graduates: Erchen Chang (sculptor, from Taipei's Muzha neighborhood), her husband Shing Tat Chung (design interaction graduate), and his sister Wai Ting Chung (clothing design background). The idea sparked during a trip to the mountains of northeast Taiwan after Erchen and Shing graduated from Slade School of Fine Art — they discovered the "softest baos" and wanted to bring that experience to London.

Started in a Hackney car park in 2012/2013, building everything from scratch — sewing aprons, constructing the stall themselves. The Soho restaurant opened in 2015 and immediately built queues out the door.

## Extracted Brand Elements

### The "Lonely Man" Logo
The iconic character originated from Erchen Chang's art installation "Rules to be a Lonely Man" — a performative piece featuring "a lonely man sitting on a three-step plinth under a single cheese plant." Inspired by Japanese B-movies, the salaryman aesthetic, oversized suits, and solitary dining culture. The team envisions all BAO restaurants as where "the Bao man would eat."

## Current State Analysis

### Strengths
1. **Art school pedigree** — Design is in the DNA, not an afterthought
2. **Iconic character** — Lonely Man is immediately recognizable
3. **Design-led differentiation** — Every touchpoint is considered
4. **Strong brand world** — Cohesive yet flexible across concepts
5. **Cultural credibility** — Collaborations with Frieze, Dover Street Market
6. **Cookbook success** — Phaidon publication extends brand reach
7. **Karaoke innovation** — Unique dining + entertainment concept
8. **BAOverse loyalty** — Digital engagement through app

### Opportunities
1. **Expansion storytelling** — The journey from street stall to empire could be celebrated more prominently
2. **Retail crossover** — Cookbook exists, but no retail bao product line (unlike competitors like Wagamama, itsu)
3. **Homepage clarity** — Website is clean but lacks immediate brand story entry point
4. **International story** — Taipei connection and pop-ups could be better surfaced
5. **Multi-concept navigation** — 7 restaurants + karaoke + sub-brands = complex UX
6. **Founder visibility** — Erchen, Shing, and Wai Ting's art backgrounds are compelling but undersurfaced

## Competitive Landscape

### 1. Flesh & Buns (Bone Daddies Group)
**Positioning:** Japanese Izakaya — DIY hirata buns with cocktails
**Locations:** Covent Garden, Oxford Circus
**Brand:** Rock 'n' roll energy, laid-back vibe
**Differentiator:** Interactive "build your own bun" experience
**Colors:** Dark, industrial aesthetic

### 2. Bone Daddies
**Positioning:** New York-style tonkotsu ramen
**Brand:** Stripped-back, rock 'n' roll, ultra-casual
**Differentiator:** 20-hour simmered pork bone broth
**Same ownership as Flesh & Buns**

### 3. Koya
**Positioning:** Handmade udon noodles — "fast food with class"
**Locations:** Soho (original), City, Broadgate
**Brand:** Cheap, cheerful, authentic Japanese
**Differentiator:** Visible noodle making, queue-worthy authenticity
**Colors:** Minimal, rustic

### BAO's Position
BAO occupies a unique space: **Taiwanese identity** (not Japanese), **design-led** (not just food-focused), **multi-concept** (beyond single dishes). The main competitive threat isn't direct — it's other design-forward, photo-worthy Asian concepts attracting the same audience.

---

## Target Customer (ICP)

**Primary:** Design-conscious Londoners (25-40) who care as much about where they eat as what they eat. Creative professionals, gallery-goers, architecture enthusiasts.

**Secondary:** Food enthusiasts seeking authentic Taiwanese beyond the generic "Asian fusion" offering.

**Psychographics:**
- Values design and aesthetic
- Follows design/culture accounts alongside food
- Willing to queue for the experience
- Photographs food (Instagram-conscious)
- Appreciates founder stories and craftsmanship
- Interested in cultural authenticity, not appropriation

---

## Market Position

BAO sits at the intersection of:
- **Design/Art world** (Frieze, Dover Street Market collaborations)
- **Premium casual dining** (Michelin-recognized but not stuffy)
- **Cultural authenticity** (Taiwanese identity, not generic Asian)

**White space opportunity:** Own "design-led Taiwanese" completely. No competitor has the art school credibility or visual system sophistication.

## Brand Strategy Recommendations

### Direction 1: "Design Purist" — Amplify the Art Foundation
Lean harder into the art school origins. Make every touchpoint feel like visiting a gallery that serves incredible food.

### Direction 2: "Taiwanese Culture Ambassador" — Heritage Celebration
Deepen the Taiwan connection. Surface the Taipei pop-ups, the regional influences, the cultural bridges.

### Direction 3: "Empire Builder" — Growth Story
Celebrate the journey from Hackney car park to seven restaurants + karaoke. The scrappy-to-sophisticated narrative.
