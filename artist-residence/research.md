## Brand Identity Analysis

### Visual Identity

**Color Palette:**
| Color | Hex | Usage |
|-------|-----|-------|
| Deep Teal | #1B4755 | Primary brand color, text |
| Cream/Ivory | #F7F6F0 | Background |
| Black | #000000 | Accents |

**Typography:**
- Primary: Serif (Georgia, Times New Roman) — gives editorial, literary feel
- Body: Sans-serif for navigation
- Overall: Traditional, understated elegance

**Visual Style:**
- Light, airy color scheme
- Photography-forward (room imagery dominates)
- Minimal navigation — location-based structure
- Squarespace-built (evident from CDN structure)
- Clean, uncluttered aesthetic

**Personality:**
- Tone: Professional, understated
- Energy: Medium — calm but engaging
- Target Audience: Design-conscious travelers seeking character over chains

### Current Website Observations

**Strengths:**
1. Beautiful, high-quality photography
2. Clear location-based navigation (London, Brighton, Bristol, Oxfordshire, Cornwall)
3. Imagery tells the story of each property's uniqueness
4. Consistent premium feel across pages

**Opportunities:**
1. **Founder story is invisible** — The Salisbury's remarkable journey from accident to accolade is completely absent from homepage
2. **Art narrative undersold** — Despite "Artist" being in the name, the artistic collaboration story isn't featured
3. **No brand differentiation messaging** — Why Artist Residence vs. The Pig or Lime Wood?
4. **MICHELIN Key recognition not prominent** — Major credential buried
5. **Hero section is purely visual** — No value proposition or hook
6. **Mobile experience basic** — Could be more immersive

## Strategic Opportunities

### 1. The Founder Story
The Salisbury's origin story is extraordinary:
- 20-year-old Justin drops out of university when mother is injured
- Takes over failing Brighton guesthouse with no money or experience
- Puts Gumtree ad for artists to decorate in exchange for board
- Hotel Inspector Alex Polizzi helps turn it around
- Now 5 hotels, all with MICHELIN Keys, married to his business partner Charlie

**This story is NOWHERE on the website.** It's the most compelling brand asset they have.

### 2. The Art Narrative
"Artist Residence" implies art is central, yet:
- No artist collaborations featured on homepage
- No "art trail" or gallery content
- No artist profiles or commissioned work showcased
- The original concept (artists decorating rooms) isn't told

### 3. The MICHELIN Key Recognition
All five properties have One MICHELIN Key (2025) — this is exceptional and should be prominent.

### 4. Location-Specific Character
Each hotel has distinct personality tied to location:
- **Brighton:** Bohemian, street art, seafront creative
- **Cornwall:** Seaside, softer artistic style, Georgian townhouse
- **London:** Pimlico intimate boutique, pop art, city sophistication
- **Oxfordshire:** Country pub reinvented, 16th-century farmhouse, steampunk touches
- **Bristol:** Converted boot factory, Georgian square, largest property

The website shows this through imagery but doesn't articulate it.

## Three Strategic Brand Directions

### Direction 1: "The Founders' Collection"
*Lean into the personal story*

- Position Justin & Charlie as the faces of the brand
- Each hotel as a chapter in their journey
- "Accidental hoteliers" narrative is charming and differentiating
- Personal touches, family feel, warmth
- Counter to corporate hotel chains

**Palette:** Warm, inviting — terracotta, cream, forest green
**Voice:** Personal, warm, storytelling
**Risk Level:** Low — builds on existing authenticity

### Direction 2: "Art in Residence"
*Reclaim the artistic positioning*

- Reinforce art as the central brand pillar
- Feature artist collaborations prominently
- Create an "art map" across properties
- Commission new works, tell their stories
- Position as cultural destinations, not just hotels

**Palette:** Gallery-inspired — white, bold accent colors, black
**Voice:** Creative, curatorial, cultural
**Risk Level:** Medium — requires ongoing artist partnerships

### Direction 3: "The Character Collection"
*Each property as a distinct brand*

- Emphasize each hotel's unique personality
- Sub-brand each location (AR Brighton, AR London, etc.)
- Unified by "Character over Chain" positioning
- Appeal to travelers seeking authenticity
- Counter to Marriott Bonvoy homogeneity

**Palette:** Varies by location, unified by typography
**Voice:** Eclectic, local, distinctive
**Risk Level:** Medium — complex to execute, dilutes unified brand

## Our Recommendation

**Direction 1: "The Founders' Collection"** with elements of Direction 2

The Salisbury story is unique, compelling, and completely untold on the website. Art remains important (it's in the name) but the personal narrative is the differentiator against Pig, Lime Wood, and Soho House — all of which are more institutional.

### Quick Wins
1. Add founder story to homepage (above fold)
2. Make MICHELIN Key recognition prominent
3. Create "Our Story" page with timeline
4. Add artist collaboration content per property
5. Update hero with brand positioning statement

### Larger Opportunities
- Brand film featuring Justin & Charlie
- "Behind the Design" content series
- Artist-in-residence program (take the name literally)
- Newsletter/journal sharing the creative process
