## Executive Summary

Justin Salisbury, now late 30s, is the co-founder of Artist Residence, one of the UK's most distinctive boutique hotel groups. What makes him remarkable is how he got here: an accidental hotelier who turned family crisis into a celebrated hospitality brand, earning MICHELIN Keys at all five properties.

**Key Insight:** Justin and Charlotte have built their brand through creativity, resourcefulness, and hands-on design — not hospitality pedigree. They're makers, not inheritors.

## Career History

### 2008: The Accidental Beginning
- Age 20, studying accountancy at Leeds University
- Mother seriously injured in traffic accident, left in coma
- Dropped out to take over her struggling Brighton seafront guesthouse (The Malvern Hotel)
- No money, no experience, no resources
- Posted Gumtree ad inviting artists to decorate rooms in exchange for board
- "Artist Residence" concept born from necessity, not strategy

### 2009-2010: Hotel Inspector Turning Point
- Property caught attention of Channel 5's Hotel Inspector
- Alex Polizzi visited and provided crucial business mentorship

- This was the catalyst for professionalizing the operation

### 2010: Cornwall Expansion
- Acquired derelict building in Penzance
- Charlotte (then girlfriend) led the renovation

- Just a carpenter, electrician, painter, and plumber on site

### 2014-2015: London & Restaurant Ventures
- Opened Artist Residence London in Pimlico (10 rooms)
- Victorian townhouse with more luxury positioning
- When restaurant tenant (64 Degrees) went into administration, they took over the space
- Opened three restaurants in nine months — learned "not to do that again!"

### 2017: Oxfordshire
- 16th-century farmhouse turned country pub
- Retained "The Masons Arms" name for pub/restaurant
- Steampunk country aesthetic
- Vegetable garden supplies the restaurant

### 2020: Bristol (Largest Project)

## Personal Background

### Family Life
- **Spouse:** Charlotte (Charlie) Salisbury — co-founder and business partner
- Met two days into Leeds University
- Charlotte studied History of Art (completed her degree before joining full-time)
- **Children:** Son Blake (born 2016), now ~10 years old
- **Pet:** Labradoodle named "Bob Bob"
- Live in 1950s terraced house in West London, near Chelsea Design Centre

### Personality Indicators

**From Interviews:**

1. **Self-Deprecating & Humble**
   - "Our story has always been about growing organic growth. It's like a weird paradox that we even exist because the whole thing is an accident!"
   - "We've never really been ready for anything, if I'm being realistic"

2. **Resourceful & Scrappy**
   - "I didn't have any money to do the work that needed to be done, so I put an advert on Gumtree"
   - "When we opened [Penzance], we didn't have any money left to do the breakfast room, so we ended up calling it the Art Gallery"

3. **Design-Obsessed**
   - "We'd do really annoying things like buy furniture and set it all out, or get the builders to paint colors on the bare walls"
   - "We overcompensated for our inexperience to make sure that we got it right"

4. **Values Work-Life Balance (Struggles With It)**
   - "We are seriously trying to work out how to get a work / life balance. It's really, really hard"
   - "Having a family is so good; it's more important than just working"

5. **Authentic & Unpretentious**
   - Hotel described as: "homely, lived-in spaces that provide talking points for their guests, make people smile"
   - "We want our places to feel comfortable and full of soul"

### Design Philosophy
- "Context and location were very important"
- "Down-to-earth, homely interiors"
- Art chosen to "make people feel good" — "something funny, colourful, nostalgic, or something that makes you stop for a double take"
- Uses vintage, upcycled furniture alongside modern art
- Retains original features wherever possible

## Decision-Making Style

Based on interviews and brand behavior:

1. **Hands-On** — Justin and Charlotte personally oversee design decisions, even sleeping on building sites
2. **Intuitive** — Decisions made by "feel" rather than extensive market research
3. **Risk-Tolerant** — Expanded before being "ready," embraced Hotel Inspector appearance despite embarrassment risk
4. **Organic Growth Preference** — "Any money we've made we've just put back in to the business"
5. **Values Authenticity** — Suspicious of cookie-cutter approaches; each hotel must be unique

---

## Recommended Outreach Approach

### Tone
- **Authentic, not salesy** — Justin will see through polish
- **Appreciative of their uniqueness** — Don't treat them like a generic client
- **Practical, not theoretical** — Show what you'd actually do
- **Peer-to-peer** — They built something from nothing; respect the craft

### Avoid
- Overly corporate language
- Suggesting they need to be "fixed"
- Generic hotel industry platitudes
- Anything that feels like a big agency pitch

### Connection Points

1. **The Founder Story Gap**
   - Their most compelling asset (the origin story) is invisible online
   - Justin clearly loves telling the story in interviews
   - Opportunity: "Your story should be on your homepage, not just in press interviews"

2. **Design Obsession**
   - They personally care deeply about every visual detail
   - Would appreciate a partner who shares that obsession
   - Show craft, not just strategy

3. **Art & Creativity**
   - Art is central to their identity and name
   - Partner with them creatively, not just commercially
   - Could reference artist collaborations we admire

4. **Family Business Values**
   - They're a married couple building something together
   - Appreciate partners who understand that dynamic
   - Maad House is also a small, hands-on team

## Strong Connection Point (For Email Personalisation)

**The "Invisible Founder" Opportunity**

Justin and Charlotte's story is extraordinary — possibly the most compelling founder story in UK boutique hospitality. Yet it's completely absent from their website:

- The accident, the Gumtree ad, the Hotel Inspector, the organic growth
- Charlotte learning to renovate by doing it
- Each hotel as a chapter in their journey

This is the perfect hook for outreach:

> "The Artist Residence properties have genuine character — but your origin story is one of the most compelling in UK hospitality, and it's completely invisible on the website. The journey from a Gumtree ad for artists to MICHELIN Keys at all five properties? That should be above the fold."

This shows:
1. We've done our research
2. We understand what makes them special
3. We see an opportunity they might not have considered
4. We respect their journey

---

## Risk Factors

1. **They're very hands-on** — May resist delegating creative decisions
2. **Budget-conscious history** — Grew through reinvesting profits, not external investment
3. **Busy** — Running 5 hotels + restaurants + family
4. **May have agency relationships** — Website is on Squarespace, so likely self-managed or small agency
