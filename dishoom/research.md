## Founder Story

### Shamil & Kavi Thakrar
The founders are cousins from the family behind **Tilda Rice** (sold for ~£250M in 2014). Shamil was a management consultant at Bain; Kavi worked at the World Bank. Neither had hospitality experience.

**The Insight:** They observed a gap in UK Indian dining - expensive Michelin-starred restaurants at one end, traditional curry houses at the other. Nothing in between that offered quality, atmosphere, and accessible pricing.

**The Inspiration:** There were over 400 Irani cafes in Bombay in the 1960s - welcoming, democratic spaces that served people of all faiths, castes, and backgrounds. Today, fewer than 30 remain. Dishoom was conceived as a "loving homage" to preserve this disappearing heritage.

### Unique Brand Storytelling
Shamil writes a detailed backstory for each new restaurant, imagining who might have opened that cafe in 1960s Bombay. Each location gets its own "founding myth" - a fictional owner with a distinct personality. This creates individual character while maintaining brand coherence.

**Example:** King's Cross tells the story of "a young Irani man" establishing a chai operation near Victoria Terminus in 1928.

- **Afroditi Krassa** - Original concept development and interior design consultancy

### Color Palette (Extracted from website)

### Typography
- **Primary:** Serif typeface - suggesting classic, timeless elegance
- **Approach:** Multiple logo variations rather than rigid standards
- **Inspiration:** 1939-era Indian advertisements, specifically *Parsi Lustre on Indian Soil* by H.D. Darukhanawala

### Design Philosophy
> "What would the owner of a Parsi cafe think, and how would they act with their 'brand'?"

Dishoom deliberately rejects rigid brand guidelines in favor of authenticity. Each location begins with its own "founding myth" that becomes the springboard for an entirely new visual world.

Key principles:
- **"Deepen, don't dilute"** - Expansion only happens if it deepens the brand experience
- **Narrative coherence over visual consistency** - Every element must support the story
- **Research-driven authenticity** - Team works with historians, typographers, and researchers in Bombay
- **"Design as storytelling"** - The 11th principle beyond Dieter Rams' 10

### Visual Elements
**Interior Design:**
- Marble tables and bentwood chairs
- Aging mirrors and ceiling fans
- Art Deco details (Victoria Terminus clock replica)
- Deliberately drooping pendant light wires
- Family photographs (traditional cafe custom)
- Monochromatic palette with blue accents (matching Britannia Cafe's brickwork)

**Authentic Details:**
- Chai glasses sourced from Bombay
- Vintage Indian toiletries in medicine cabinets
- Gola ice machine (Chowpatty Beach reference)
- Rules sign referencing historical Cafe Bastani
- Music curation: Mohammed Rafi, Django Reinhardt

## Digital Presence Analysis

### Website (dishoom.com)
**Strengths:**
- Clean, cream-toned aesthetic
- Food-forward photography
- Clear booking integration
- Journal section with design stories

**Opportunities:**
- Hero section could better surface the heritage story
- Booking experience is functional but doesn't reflect the rich narrative
- Menu UX is straightforward but lacks the personality of the physical space
- Mobile navigation could be more refined
- The queue/no-reservations experience (part of the brand mystique) isn't reflected digitally

### The Queue Experience
Historically, Dishoom built its reputation partly on the no-reservations queue experience - the anticipation became part of the brand. They now accept reservations at all locations, but this transition could be better narrated as brand evolution rather than simple operational change.

## Competitive Landscape

### Direct Competitors

| Competitor | Positioning | Locations | Distinguishing Feature |
|------------|-------------|-----------|------------------------|
| **Mowgli Street Food** | "Indian home cooking" | 25+ UK | Founder Nisha Katona's personal story, £1M+ charity, playful energy |
| **Hoppers** | Sri Lankan/South Indian | 3 London | JKS Restaurants, toddy shop inspiration, Tropical Modernism design |
| **Tandoor Chop House** | North Indian x British Chop House | 1 London | Ennismore (Hoxton), brass tandoor ovens, premium cuts |
| **Gunpowder** | Home-style Indian | 4 London + Lisbon | Family recipes, small plates, chutney pot light fixtures |

### Competitive Analysis

**vs. Mowgli**
- Dishoom: Bombay nostalgia, literary sophistication, Irani cafe heritage
- Mowgli: Home cooking, founder-led, younger energy, botanical interiors
- Key difference: Dishoom is preserving heritage; Mowgli is celebrating home

**vs. Hoppers**
- Dishoom: Bombay broad, Irani cafe specific
- Hoppers: Sri Lankan specific, toddy shop/Tropical Modernism
- Key difference: Regional focus (Hoppers narrower but deeper)

**vs. Tandoor Chop House**
- Dishoom: Cafe heritage, accessible pricing
- Tandoor: British chop house fusion, premium positioning
- Key difference: Tandoor is "high-low fusion"; Dishoom is "authentic preservation"

**vs. Gunpowder**
- Dishoom: Irani cafe heritage, larger scale
- Gunpowder: Intimate, family recipes, art deco elements
- Key difference: Scale and heritage specificity

## Strategic Opportunities for Maad House

### Key Angles

1. **Digital-Physical Gap**
   The physical Dishoom experience is legendary - the interiors, the storytelling, the atmosphere. The digital experience is clean but doesn't capture the magic. There's an opportunity to bring more of the narrative richness online.

2. **Heritage Story Surfacing**
   The Irani cafe preservation story is powerful but requires digging. The founders' Tilda heritage, the declining cafe count (400 → 30), the "founding myths" for each location - these are buried on the blog rather than front and center.

3. **Booking UX as Brand Moment**
   The booking experience is transactional. Given Dishoom's brand strength, the reservation flow could be a mini-storytelling moment - introducing the location's "founding myth" or the history of the dish you're about to experience.

4. **Menu as Heritage Guide**
   The menu describes dishes but doesn't connect them to the broader Bombay narrative. Each dish could be a doorway to the heritage story.

5. **Permit Room Differentiation**
   The Permit Room concept (bar-focused sister brand) could have a more distinct visual identity while remaining connected to Dishoom.

6. **Journal Enhancement**
   The Dishoom Journal has excellent content but could be more prominently featured - it's the kind of brand storytelling asset most companies dream of having.

## Pitch Strategy

### Lead with Heritage Appreciation
Show deep understanding of the Irani cafe story and the "deepen, don't dilute" philosophy.

### Focus on Digital-Physical Gap
The opportunity isn't to change their brand - it's to translate their exceptional physical experience into their digital presence.

### Respect the & SMITH Relationship
They have a long-standing design partnership. Position Maad House as complementary (digital focus) not competitive.

### Highlight the Narrative Opportunity
The "founding myths" and heritage storytelling are extraordinary - help them amplify this unique asset.
