## Connection Points

### Wahaca Experience (PRIMARY HOOK)

Gavin spent 4 years at Wahaca, another founder-led casual dining brand with a strong origin story (Thomasina Miers, MasterChef winner). This creates direct parallels:

- **Founder narrative:** Both brands built on personal journeys
- **Scaling authenticity:** Wahaca maintained Mexican authenticity at scale
- **Brand evolution:** Wahaca has evolved visually while keeping core identity

**Angle:** "Your experience taking Wahaca from regional to national while preserving Thomasina's vision is exactly what Pizza Pilgrims needs now - evolving the brand without losing Thom and James's pilgrimage story."

### Operations Background

As an operations leader rather than a marketing executive:
- Will appreciate efficiency and ROI arguments
- May be skeptical of "brand fluff" - needs practical value
- Will want to understand implementation and rollout

**Angle:** Position brand refresh as operational enablement - cleaner systems, more efficient marketing, better conversion.

### Chef Origins

Started career as a chef - understands product quality viscerally:
- Authenticity of ingredients and technique matters
- Brand should reflect craft, not just marketing
- Will resonate with "substance over style" positioning

## Communication Preferences

### Recommended Approach

1. **Lead with Insight, Not Pitch**
   - Share competitive analysis showing Franco Manca's refresh
   - Demonstrate understanding of market dynamics
   - Position as strategic partner, not vendor

2. **Speak Operations Language**
   - "Streamline your digital touchpoints"
   - "Consistent brand assets across all 25+ locations"
   - "Reduce design iteration time"

3. **Honor the Founders**
   - Never suggest the pilgrimage story is wrong
   - Frame as "elevating" not "fixing"
   - Show deep understanding of their journey

4. **Be Concise**
   - CEO of a 25+ site operation is time-poor
   - One clear ask per communication
   - Bullet points over paragraphs

### Tone

- **Professional but warm** (matches Pizza Pilgrims brand)
- **Confident but not arrogant** (he's achieved a lot)
- **Strategic** (speak to the CEO, not the marketing manager)
