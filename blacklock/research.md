## Executive Summary

Blacklock is a London-born chop house group that has carved a distinctive niche by reviving the pre-war British chophouse tradition. Founded in 2015 by Gordon Ker, a former M&A lawyer who left his career to pursue his passion for chops, the brand has grown to 7 locations across London, Manchester, and Birmingham. Their positioning - "same quality as Hawksmoor, better prices" - has resonated strongly with the market.

## Brand Story

### The Founder: Gordon Ker

Gordon Ker was working as a lawyer at Olswang in M&A private equity when he decided to leave the "hamster wheel" in 2013. Key facts:

- **Background:** Fell into law, immediately realized it wasn't for him
- **Inspiration:** Worked with Hawksmoor founders (Will Beckett & Huw Gott) as clients during their Graphite Capital deal
- **Bold move:** Quit law, worked as a waiter at Hawksmoor for 10 months to learn the restaurant business
- **The twist:** When Ker told the Hawksmoor founders about his plans, Will Beckett "spat out his cocktail" and called it "a terrible idea"
- **Irony:** Despite initial misgivings, the Hawksmoor founders became investors in Blacklock

**Quote from Ker:** "Without them, we wouldn't be where we are today. We probably would have gone bust more than once."

### The Concept

Blacklock revives the British chophouse tradition from the 1690s:
- Pre-portioned cuts of meat cooked over open coals
- Basement locations (the first was a former brothel in Soho)
- Unpretentious, familiar, "open to all"
- Charcoal and English oak cooking

### First Location Challenge

Finding the first space was brutal:
> "I'd speak to the landlord and they'd say, 'Tell me about your other restaurants.' I'd say, 'I don't have any.' They'd say, 'Okay, so tell me about the restaurants you have had?' I'd say, 'None.'"

They overcame water leaks and lack of gas/electricity to launch the Soho basement "as cheaply as possible" in 2015.

## Business Philosophy

### People-First Approach

**Quote from Gordon Ker:**
> "The first thing I say to people at their induction is that most restaurants will tell you to put the customers first - to make them happy. Of course they are important, but they are number two in our business because it's our people who are important."

> "Focus on being a great employer first and foremost. This is more important to us than being a great restaurant. We think the former enables the latter but not necessarily vice versa."

### Operations Philosophy

> "Keep your operations simple and simpler than you think they need to be. For me, quality and consistency are the keys to building a great restaurant."

### Value Philosophy

Amid economic pressures, Ker prioritizes delivering better value rather than cutting corners - customers are making dining occasions "more special and important" but spending less frequently.

## Certifications & Values

- **Focus on British sourcing** - Meat from Warren family in Cornwall (third-generation farmers since 1880)
- **Whole animal philosophy** - Nose-to-tail approach

## Brand Opportunities

### Current Strengths

1. **Distinctive positioning** - Reviving a historical concept (chophouse vs steakhouse)
2. **Strong founder story** - Lawyer-to-restaurateur narrative is compelling
3. **Value proposition clear** - "Hawksmoor quality, better prices"
4. **Social dining focus** - Sharing platters differentiate from individual-portion competitors
5. **Basement aesthetic** - Creates memorable, atmospheric experiences
6. **B Corp status** - Authentically values-driven

### Brand Identity Opportunities

1. **Purple accent is distinctive** but underutilized in current visual identity
2. **Heritage story** could be amplified more in visual design
3. **"Chop Love" messaging** is warm but could be more consistently applied
4. **Typography** could better reflect the pre-war chophouse heritage
5. **Photography style** is strong but could emphasize the theatrical elements more
6. **Digital presence** feels slightly dated compared to positioning

### Growth Considerations

- Regional expansion (Manchester, Birmingham) needs consistent brand application
- Differentiation from Hawksmoor becomes more important as they grow
- The "basement speakeasy" aesthetic is hard to replicate at scale
