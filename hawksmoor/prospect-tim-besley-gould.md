## Recommended Outreach Approach

### Tone
- **Respectful of tenure** — He's been there from the start; don't talk down
- **Operational focus** — Lead with practical improvements, not theoretical rebrand
- **Quality recognition** — Acknowledge Hawksmoor's brand strength first
- **No hard sell** — He's seen it all; be direct and useful

### What NOT to say
- Don't suggest the brand needs "fixing" — it's successful
- Don't oversell — he'll see through hyperbole
- Don't ignore the team's achievements — sustainability, expansion, awards

### What TO emphasize
- **Digital experience gap** — Acknowledge brand is excellent; website can catch up
- **Quick wins** — Operational mindset will appreciate practical improvements
- **Competitor context** — Frame as market positioning, not criticism
- **Portfolio relevance** — Byron/multi-site restaurant experience

### Opening Hook Options
1. "Hawksmoor has built something rare — a genuinely premium position in the UK steakhouse market." *(respect + specific observation)*
2. "After 19 years of building Hawksmoor's reputation in person, the digital experience has some catching up to do." *(tenure acknowledgment)*
3. "The Rare Breeds programme and B Corp certification tell a story that deserves a bigger digital platform." *(values alignment)*

## Key Insight for Outreach

**Tim is a "doer" not a "show-er."**

The "Unsung Hero" award tells you everything:
- He's operational, not marketing
- He's respected for substance
- He's probably skeptical of agencies that overpromise

**Lead with utility, not flash.** The pitch deck should demonstrate understanding and provide immediately useful analysis — not just pretty slides.

## Decision-Making Context

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| **Decision authority** | High — COO controls operational budgets |
| **Brand sensitivity** | High — 19 years invested in the brand |
| **Skepticism level** | Medium-high — seen many pitches |
| **Time availability** | Low — busy running multi-site operations |
| **Preferred communication** | Likely direct, no-nonsense |

### Likely Objections
1. "We have an internal marketing team" → Frame as external perspective, not replacement
2. "We're focused on expansion" → Position digital as supporting scale
3. "Budget is tight" → Lead with quick wins, not full rebrand

---

## Follow-Up Intelligence Needs

If initial outreach succeeds:
1. Who handles digital/marketing internally?
2. What's the relationship with their current agency (if any)?
3. What's on the roadmap — new locations, digital initiatives?
4. Is there appetite for a brand refresh, or just tactical improvements?
