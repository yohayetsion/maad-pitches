**Date:** 2026-02-03
**Target:** Julian Dunkerton (Owner) & Jade Holland Cooper (Co-Owner)

## CRITICAL DISCOVERY: OWNERSHIP CLARIFICATION

**The original email draft targets "Sam Pearman" — THIS IS INCORRECT.**

Sam and Georgie Pearman **founded** The Lucky Onion in 2006 but **left the business in 2017**. They now run a separate hospitality group called **Country Creatures**.

**Current Ownership (since 2017):**
- **Julian Dunkerton** — Superdry co-founder, CEO, and owner of Lucky Onion Group
- **Jade Holland Cooper** — Fashion designer (Holland Cooper), co-owner

**The email must be rewritten to target Julian Dunkerton or the hotel's general manager.**

## Strategic Brand Directions

### Direction 1: Unified Luxury House

**Concept:** "One House, Three Experiences"

Bring YOKU, The Terrace, and Gin & Juice under a stronger No.131 master brand. Create visual cohesion while maintaining each venue's distinct personality. Position No.131 as a destination complex, not just a hotel with restaurants.

**Rationale:** Currently feels like three separate businesses sharing an address. A unified brand architecture would strengthen the overall proposition.

### Direction 2: Founder-Forward Storytelling

**Concept:** "The Dunkerton & Holland Cooper Collection"

Lean into Julian and Jade's fashion/entrepreneurial credentials. Position No.131 as the hospitality expression of their lifestyle brand portfolio (Superdry, Holland Cooper, Dunkertons Cider). Cross-promotion opportunities with fashion events, cider tastings, style packages.

**Rationale:** Strong founder stories are underutilized in current marketing. The fashion connection is unique among Cotswolds hotels.

### Direction 3: Contemporary Cotswolds

**Concept:** "Georgian Meets Tokyo"

Embrace the unexpected YOKU Japanese concept as a brand differentiator. Position No.131 as the Cotswolds' most eclectic luxury hotel — traditional architecture with contemporary international cuisine. Challenge the "cream teas and tweed" Cotswolds stereotype.

**Rationale:** YOKU is genuinely distinctive. Most Cotswolds hotels lean into traditional British. This could attract younger, more adventurous guests.

## Website Technical Issues Noted

1. **theluckyonion.com** — Currently showing cPanel error page (DNS/hosting issue)
2. **Booking widget errors** — "Cannot GET /widget/Standard/..." errors on table booking
3. **Mobile optimization** — Navigation could be simplified
4. **Page speed** — Multiple large images without lazy loading

---

## Recommended Approach for Outreach

### Target Decision Maker

**Primary:** Julian Dunkerton (Owner)
- Email likely via company: info@no131.com or through LinkedIn
- Note: Very high-profile, may be difficult to reach directly

**Secondary:** General Manager / Marketing Manager at No.131
- Email: reservations@no131.com (for escalation)
- More likely to action a brand review proposal

### Key Hooks for Outreach

1. **Domain issue** — theluckyonion.com is broken (urgent)
2. **Brand unification** — Three F&B venues need cohesive identity
3. **Fashion crossover** — Holland Cooper integration could be stronger
4. **Competitive pressure** — The Pig, Artist Residence, Soho Farmhouse are strong

### Tone Recommendation

Julian Dunkerton is a self-made entrepreneur who returned to Superdry in a dramatic boardroom battle. He appreciates:
- Direct, no-nonsense communication
- Business results over fluffy creative talk
- Quality and attention to detail
- Independent thinking

**Avoid:** Sycophancy, over-explanation, generic agency pitches
