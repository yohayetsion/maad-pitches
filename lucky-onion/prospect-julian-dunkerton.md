## Recent News & Challenges

### No.131 Planning Battles (2024-2025)

- Ongoing disputes with neighbours over outdoor dining area
- Criticism of "tatty tents" at the hotel
- Planning approved in late 2024/early 2025 for permanent outdoor structure
- Julian publicly defended plans as "make or break" for the venue
- Shows he's personally invested in No.131's success

### Superdry Turnaround

- Primary focus since 2019 return

- Means No.131/hospitality is likely secondary priority
- But emotional attachment to Cheltenham ventures remains strong

- May be more receptive to brand discussion than busy Superdry CEO

---

## Recommended Outreach Approach

### Primary Target: Julian Dunkerton (or GM on his behalf)

**Email Contact:**
- Direct email unlikely to be public
- Try: LinkedIn message (may have assistants managing)
- Or: info@no131.com addressed to "Julian Dunkerton & Team"

**Recommended Approach:**
1. Lead with **specific observation** about No.131 (not generic flattery)
2. Note **theluckyonion.com domain issue** — shows you've done homework
3. Frame as **brand unification opportunity** across YOKU/Terrace/Gin & Juice
4. Reference his **fashion expertise** — he'll appreciate design talk
5. Keep it **brief and direct** — he values efficiency
6. **Don't oversell** — he's pitched constantly

### Alternative Target: Jade Holland Cooper

**Email Contact:**
- More likely via Holland Cooper brand
- Instagram DM may work (she's active)

**Recommended Approach:**
- Frame around **Holland Cooper x No.131 brand synergy**
- Discuss how design language could better connect the properties
- She may be more interested in creative/visual discussion
- Could be better entry point than Julian

### Hooks to Use

1. **"I noticed theluckyonion.com is currently showing an error page..."** — shows attention to detail
2. **"YOKU is a distinctive concept for the Cotswolds..."** — specific, not generic
3. **"The Holland Cooper integration could go further..."** — speaks to their actual strategy
4. **"Three venues, one address — but no unified brand story"** — actionable observation

### Tone Calibration

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| Be direct and specific | Use vague flattery ("love your work") |
| Show you understand his businesses | Pitch generic agency services |
| Respect his time (short email) | Write long introductions |
| Offer something useful (pitch deck) | Ask for time without giving value |
| Reference Cheltenham roots | Treat him as just another prospect |

---

## Connection Points for Personalisation

1. **Entrepreneur to entrepreneur** — If Yohay's background resonates
2. **Fashion + Hospitality crossover** — Unusual combination, interesting positioning
3. **Cheltenham pride** — He's deeply rooted there
4. **Quality obsession** — Superdry was built on details
5. **Turnaround narrative** — He enjoys proving critics wrong

---

## Risk Assessment

**Why this might be difficult:**
- Julian is extremely high-profile (£440M net worth)
- Primary focus is Superdry turnaround, not hospitality
- May have agency relationships already
- Planning battles suggest he's defensive about criticism
- Email to "sam@theluckyonion.com" won't reach anyone (Sam left in 2017)

**Why it might work:**
- No.131 is personal to him (met Jade there)
- He values quality and detail
- Small team pitch may appeal vs big agency overhead
- Specific observations show genuine interest
- Domain issue is legitimately urgent

---

## Corrected Email Target

**Remove:** Sam Pearman (sam@theluckyonion.com)
**Add:** General inquiry to No.131 (reservations@no131.com or info@no131.com) addressed to the ownership team

**Or:** Direct LinkedIn outreach to Julian Dunkerton with a connection request note.
