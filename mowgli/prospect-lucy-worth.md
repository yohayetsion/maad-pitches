## Career History

| Period | Company | Role |
|--------|---------|------|
| 2025–Present | Mowgli Street Food | CEO |

---

## Key Connection Points

### Byron Hamburgers (CRITICAL)
- Lucy spent nearly 5 years at Byron
- Maad House worked with Byron on brand refresh across 50+ locations
- She would have seen/experienced brand consistency challenges firsthand
- This is the primary hook for outreach

---

## Leadership Style & Communication

**From colleague testimonials:**
- "Outperform expectations through effective planning"
- "Ability to develop strong teams underneath her"
- "Strong financial knowledge — comfortable with budgets and P&Ls"
- "Works at tactical AND strategic level"
- "Real strength in creating vision and instilling that in others"
- "Identifying talent and developing talent at all levels"

**Nisha Katona's description:**
> "The most perspicacious, able and intuitive guardian of all that Mowgli stands for."

**Interpretation:** She's an OPERATOR, not a marketer. Practical, results-oriented, financially-minded. Speak her language: growth, consistency, scale, ROI.

---

## Current Mandate

Katona promoted her to "protect and promote" the business:
- Oversee expansion (26 sites → Dublin next)
- Maintain brand consistency across growth
- First time founder has stepped back from CEO role

**Implication:** She's focused on scaling without breaking what works. Brand consistency across locations is likely top of mind.

---

## Recommended Approach

| Element | Recommendation |
|---------|----------------|
| **Tone** | Operator-speak: practical, direct, no fluff |
| **Hook** | Byron connection (instant credibility) |
| **Frame** | Growth challenges, consistency at scale |
| **Avoid** | Marketing jargon, fluffy promises |
| **CTA** | Low friction (reply to email) |
