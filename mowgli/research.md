## Current State Analysis

### Strengths
1. **Strong founder story** — Nisha's journey from barrister to restaurateur is compelling
2. **Clear positioning** — Indian street food vs. traditional curry house
3. **Consistent visual identity** — Dark palette with gold accents is distinctive
4. **Community focus** — Mowgli Trust, charity work, local impact
5. **Growing brand** — Rapid expansion across UK
6. **Media presence** — BBC, ITV, cookbooks give credibility

### Opportunities
1. **Website storytelling** — The founder story is buried; could be more prominent
2. **Visual hierarchy** — Homepage lacks clear flow; multiple CTAs compete
3. **Hero section** — Current hero is a Valentine's promo; permanent hero would strengthen brand
4. **Mobile experience** — Dense navigation could be simplified
5. **Photography consistency** — Mix of styles across the site
6. **Differentiation** — Could more clearly distinguish from Dishoom's Bombay café positioning

## Target Customer (ICP)

**Primary:** Urban professionals aged 25-45 who want authentic Indian flavours beyond the traditional curry house, appreciate quality ingredients and ethical business practices.

**Secondary:** Families and groups looking for a casual yet elevated dining experience.

- Values authenticity and provenance
- Interested in the story behind their food

## Market Position

Mowgli sits between:
- **Dishoom** (more premium, heritage-focused, Bombay-specific)
- **Bundobust** (more casual, beer-focused, shareable)

**White space opportunity:** Own the "Indian home cooking" narrative more strongly — this is authentic Indian, not café culture nostalgia or street snacks + beer.

---

## Brand Strategy Recommendations

### Direction 1: "Evolution" — Refine Current Identity
Keep the dark palette and warmth, but modernize typography and strengthen storytelling.

### Direction 2: "Heritage Reinvented" — Bold Indian Modernism
Take cues from contemporary Indian design (not colonial nostalgia like Dishoom), embrace colour.

### Direction 3: "Premium Home Kitchen" — Elevated Authenticity
Position as the most authentic "home cooking" experience — warmer, more inviting, less restaurant-y.
