# Design Review: Mowgli Pitch Deck

> **Reviewed by**: Design Team (Director of Design)

## Executive Summary

The Mowgli pitch deck demonstrates strong strategic thinking and thorough research. However, **the AI-generated logos are a critical weakness** that could undermine credibility with an operator-minded CEO like Lucy Worth. The deck needs selective refinement before it can be sent.

**Verdict**: 7/10 — Good strategy, needs asset quality improvement

## Part 1: Pitch Deck Assessment

### What Works Well

#### 1. Deck Structure & Flow
- **Strong narrative arc**: Moves logically from current state → analysis → directions → recommendation → quick wins → CTA
- **10 slides is appropriate**: Not too long for a cold outreach deck
- **Quick Wins slide is excellent**: Showing actionable improvements demonstrates competence
- **Before/after format**: The annotated screenshot + wireframe comparison is compelling

#### 2. Visual Design Quality
- **Clean, professional styling**: The CSS is well-executed with consistent spacing, typography, and responsive breakpoints
- **Color palette integration**: Using Mowgli's brand colors (#8D764B, #1E2421, #F2EFEB) shows attention to detail
- **Good use of client theming**: Dark slides match Mowgli's aesthetic
- **Navigation UX**: Progress bar, keyboard controls, touch support — all polished

#### 3. Research Depth
- **Competitor analysis is strong**: Dishoom, Bundobust, Masala Zone positioning is accurate
- **Strengths/opportunities framework**: Balanced and honest assessment
- **Market position whitespace**: "Indian home cooking" narrative is a smart angle

#### 4. Strategic Recommendations
- **Direction 1 (Evolution) is correct**: Conservative approach for an established brand with 25+ locations
- **Hybrid recommendation is smart**: "Evolution with elements from Direction 3" shows nuance
- **Quick Wins are tactical and achievable**: Hero section improvements are concrete

### What Needs Improvement

#### 1. AI-Generated Logos — CRITICAL ISSUE

**Problem**: The logos are obviously AI-generated and do not represent what Maad House would actually design.

| Logo | Issue |
|------|-------|
| **Minimalist geometric (Direction 1)** | Acceptable concept but generic — looks like stock templates |
| **Script "Mowgli" (Direction 1)** | Reads as "craft beer" not "Indian restaurant" — wrong tone |
| **Geometric M with teal/orange (Direction 2)** | Completely wrong palette — Mowgli uses gold/dark green |
| **"Indian Home Cooking" pot (Direction 3)** | Says "THE DAILY MASALA" — completely wrong brand name |
| **Saffron Bloom lotus (Direction 3)** | Says "SAFFRON BLOOM" — wrong brand, looks like spa not restaurant |

**Risk**: An operator CEO will immediately recognize these as AI placeholders. It signals we haven't done real design work yet.

**Recommendation**:
- **Option A (Preferred)**: Remove logos entirely from Direction slides — focus on palette, typography, and mood description instead
- **Option B**: Create quick hand-sketched concepts that communicate "this is a direction, not a finished product"
- **Option C**: Use existing Mowgli logo variations with color/typography treatments applied

#### 2. Direction 2 Color Mismatch

The Heritage Reinvented direction shows orange (#E85D04) and teal (#0B525B) palette — colors Mowgli doesn't use. This creates visual disconnection.

**Fix**: Either explain this is a departure from current palette (and show how it relates to Indian design trends) OR adjust palette to be a more radical evolution of existing gold/cream/dark.

#### 3. Direction 3 Assets Are Completely Wrong

The "Premium Home Kitchen" slide shows:
- A logo that says "Indian Home Cooking - Your Family Kitchen" (generic)
- A badge that says "THE DAILY MASALA" (wrong brand entirely)
- A lotus logo that says "SAFFRON BLOOM" (completely different restaurant)

**Fix**: Remove these assets. Replace with a mood board description: earthy tones, hand-crafted textures, warm photography style.

#### 4. Recommendation Slide Lacks Visual Proof

The "Our Recommendation" slide (Slide 8) is text-heavy with no visual support. After showing three visual directions, landing on text feels like a letdown.

**Fix**: Add a simple visual summary — even just the recommended palette + typography pairing, or a mood reference image.

#### 5. Quick Wins Wireframe

The wireframe in the "After" section is good but could be elevated:
- Consider showing actual Mowgli content in the wireframe (their messaging, their CTA)
- The wireframe feels generic — adding brand-specific details would strengthen it

## Part 2: GTM Engine Design Integration

### Recommended Design Team Touchpoints

Based on the GTM Engine plan, design review should occur at these stages:

```
LEAD SOURCING → ENRICHMENT → QUALIFICATION → [DESIGN CHECKPOINT 1]
                                                     ↓
                                            PERSONALIZATION
                                                     ↓
                                            [DESIGN CHECKPOINT 2]
                                                     ↓
                                              OUTREACH
```

### Checkpoint 1: A-Tier Qualification Gate

**Trigger**: When a prospect is qualified as A-tier (score 80+)

**Design Review Questions**:
1. Is this a brand/web prospect where visual assets would add value?
2. Does the prospect's industry warrant custom research visuals?
3. What's the competitive pitch environment? (Premium brands expect premium pitches)

**Output**: Design brief for pitch deck customization

### Checkpoint 2: Pre-Send Quality Gate

**Trigger**: Before any A-tier pitch deck is sent

**Design Review Checklist**:
- [ ] No AI-generated logos used as if they were real designs
- [ ] All assets correctly branded (no placeholder names)
- [ ] Color palette is accurate to prospect's brand
- [ ] Screenshot annotations are accurate and readable
- [ ] Wireframes/mockups communicate intent clearly
- [ ] Deck passes the "5-second test" — does it look professional at a glance?

### Standard Design Deliverables by Prospect Tier

| Tier | Design Deliverables | Design Time |
|------|---------------------|-------------|
| **A-tier** | Full pitch deck, annotated screenshots, wireframe concept, mood direction | 2-4 hours |
| **B-tier** | Templated deck with swapped colors/screenshots | 30-60 mins |
| **C-tier** | No design assets (email-only outreach) | N/A |

### A-Tier Pitch Deck Standard Components

1. **Current state screenshot** (annotated) — Always include
2. **Color/typography extraction** — Quick brand analysis
3. **Competitive landscape visual** — If relevant to pitch
4. **Direction palette cards** — Colors + typography, NOT logos
5. **Quick wins wireframe** — Specific to prospect's site
6. **Mood references** (optional) — For design-heavy pitches

### What Should NOT Be in Cold Pitch Decks

- AI-generated logos presented as real options
- Mockups that could be mistaken for finished work
- Competitor site screenshots without permission
- Before/after comparisons that make the current site look bad without being actionable

## Part 3: Specific Recommendations for Mowgli Deck

### Immediate Changes (Before Sending)

1. **Remove or replace Direction slide logos**
   - Replace with: "Visual Direction: [Description]" + Palette + Typography only
   - Or: Use Mowgli's existing logo with treatment variations

2. **Fix Direction 3 assets**
   - Remove "Saffron Bloom" and "The Daily Masala" logos
   - Replace with written description + color swatches only

3. **Strengthen Recommendation slide**
   - Add a simple visual: Recommended palette + font pairing

4. **Verify all text is correct**
   - Double-check "February 2026" date
   - Ensure CTA links work (Calendly, mailto)

### Optional Enhancements

1. **Personalize for Lucy Worth**
   - Add a brief slide that references Byron connection
   - "We've worked with brands you know — including Byron during your tenure"

2. **Add portfolio proof**
   - One slide showing a relevant Maad House project (Byron? Ardour?)
   - Keep it minimal — one image, one sentence

3. **Hero wireframe customization**
   - Replace generic wireframe labels with actual Mowgli content:
   - "Your neighbourhood Indian home kitchen" as headline
   - "Book a Table" as CTA
   - Nisha's quote in founder story block

## Design Team Role in GTM Workflow

### Proposed Process

```
/lead-qualify → A-tier confirmed
