## Executive Summary

## Competitive Landscape

### 1. Lime Wood Hotel (Sister Brand)

**Website:** limewoodhotel.co.uk
**Positioning:** 5* New Forest luxury with Italian-influenced dining

| Aspect | Lime Wood | The Pig |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| **Price Point** | Higher | Mid-luxury |
| **Formality** | More refined | More casual |
| **Cuisine** | Italian (Angela Hartnett) | British garden-led |
| **Spa** | Major feature (Herb House) | "Potting Shed" treatments |
| **Visual Brand** | Clean, modern serif | Warm, earthy |
| **Primary Color** | #C4D600 (lime green) | #512C1C (brown) |

**Insight**: Same ownership (Home Grown Hotels), but distinct positioning. Lime Wood = aspirational luxury. The Pig = accessible authenticity.

### 2. Soho Farmhouse

**Website:** sohofarmhouse.com
**Positioning:** Members' club countryside escape

| Aspect | Soho Farmhouse | The Pig |
|--------|----------------|---------|
| **Access** | Members only (from 325/month) | Open to public |
| **Scale** | 100 acres, 114 bedrooms | Boutique (varies by property) |
| **Activities** | Extensive (horses, shooting, spa) | Walking, gardens, treatments |
| **Vibe** | Exclusive, celebrity crowd | Everyman luxury |
| **Visual Brand** | Minimalist, neutral | Characterful, warm |

**Insight**: Soho Farmhouse targets exclusivity-seekers. The Pig offers similar countryside escape without membership barriers.

### 3. Artist Residence

**Website:** artistresidence.co.uk
**Positioning:** Bohemian boutique hotels with artistic soul

| Aspect | Artist Residence | The Pig |
|--------|------------------|---------|
| **Locations** | London, Brighton, Bristol, Oxford, Cornwall | Rural/coastal England |
| **Aesthetic** | Eclectic, collected, arty | Rustic, garden-focused |
| **F&B Focus** | Good but secondary | Central to brand |
| **Price** | Lower | Higher |
| **Visual Brand** | Dark teal (#1B4755), minimal | Warm browns, detailed |

**Insight**: Artist Residence appeals to creative urbanites. Less polished photography, more design-forward.

### 4. Calcot Collection

**Website:** calcot.co
**Positioning:** Cotswolds family-friendly spa hotel

| Aspect | Calcot | The Pig |
|--------|--------|---------|
| **Locations** | Single (Cotswolds) | 9 UK locations |
| **Family Focus** | Strong (kids' facilities) | Moderate |

| **Visual Brand** | Gold (#CBB21A), script fonts | Brown, serif fonts |

**Insight**: Calcot competes most directly with THE PIG-at Combe. More traditional country house positioning.

## Strengths

### 1. Distinctive Brand Story
The kitchen garden concept is ownable, genuine, and difficult to replicate. Not a marketing gimmick but operational reality.

### 2. Photography Quality
Exceptional imagery that captures the brand essence. Lifestyle shots feel authentic, not staged.

### 3. Consistency Across Portfolio
9 unique properties with cohesive brand experience. Each PIG has character but feels connected.

### 4. Strong Founder Legacy
Robin Hutson's Hotel du Vin pedigree and 2011 origin story provide credibility and heritage.

### 5. Sustainability Credentials
Three-star Food Made Good rating is defensible proof point, not greenwashing.

### 6. Social Proof
Active #thepighotel Instagram community with genuine user-generated content.

## Opportunities

### 1. Digital Booking Experience
The website effectively showcases the brand but the booking journey doesn't fully capture the warmth of the on-property experience. Opportunity to create a more immersive, garden-inspired booking flow.

### 2. Mobile Experience
Current site is functional on mobile but could be enhanced. The imagery-rich approach needs optimization for smaller screens.

### 3. Typography Refinement
While Literata and Ivyora work well, there's opportunity to develop a more distinctive typographic voice - perhaps commissioning custom lettering for key phrases.

### 4. Color Palette Extension
The current palette is grounded and appropriate but could expand to include more of the garden palette - seasonal colors that change with the menu.

### 5. Logo Modernization
The current wordmark is functional but basic. Opportunity to create a more distinctive mark that captures the playfulness and warmth of the brand.

### 6. Interactive Menu Storytelling
The 25-mile philosophy could be brought to life with interactive maps showing current suppliers, seasonal availability, and garden updates.

### 7. Room Category Clarity
9 properties x multiple room types creates complexity. Opportunity to simplify and visualize the range.
