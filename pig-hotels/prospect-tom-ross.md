## Background & Heritage

### Family Hospitality Legacy

Tom Ross comes from a hospitality family. His parents, Stephen and Penny Ross, owned and operated several Bath-based properties:

> "For a while my dad was the youngest Michelin star chef in the country."

His parents had "an innovative approach to 'doing things differently'" - this ethos clearly influenced Tom's approach at The Pig.

### "Home Grown" Talent

Robin Hutson (The Pig founder) described Ross as "an outstanding example of 'home-grown' talent" - someone who grew up within the organization rather than being hired in at senior level. This is significant:

1. He deeply understands the brand from the ground up
2. He has operational credibility (started as GM)
3. He values the culture and would likely be protective of brand integrity

---

## Leadership Style Indicators

### From Interviews & Coverage

1. **Operationally Grounded**: Rose through GM ranks, not a corporate transplant
2. **Steady Hand in Transition**: Led through KSL Capital Partners acquisition without disrupting culture
3. **Brand Custodian**: Long tenure suggests alignment with Hutson's vision
4. **Humble**: Limited personal press presence; lets the brand speak

### Communication Preferences (Inferred)

- **Likely appreciates**: Substance over style, operational awareness, respect for The Pig's heritage
- **Likely skeptical of**: Generic agency pitches, "we can transform your brand" messaging
- **Probably values**: Partners who understand hospitality, evidence of quality work

---

## Connection Points for Outreach

### 1. Hotel du Vin Connection
Both Tom Ross and Robin Hutson have Hotel du Vin in their backgrounds. If Maad House has any connection to HdV or similar boutique hotel brands, worth mentioning.

### 2. Bath-Based Heritage
Ross's family operated Bath properties; The Pig-near Bath was his first GM role. Local connection if relevant.

### 3. Operational Excellence
He rose through operations, not marketing. Pitch should emphasize how design/brand work supports operational goals (bookings, guest satisfaction) not just aesthetics.

### 4. The "Home Grown" Ethos
The Pig grows its own vegetables; it also grew Tom Ross internally. Frame Maad House as a partner who builds long-term relationships, not a transactional agency.

### 5. Transition Period Opportunity
With new CEO Kevin Styles, there may be appetite for fresh perspectives. Ross in advisory role might have bandwidth for strategic conversations.

## Recommended Approach

### Tone
- Reverential of what The Pig has built
- Practical, not flashy
- Hospitality-literate (show you understand the industry)
- Peer-to-peer, not salesy

### Framing
- "Enhancement" not "transformation"
- "The digital experience could match what guests feel on-property"
- Acknowledge the brand is already strong

### Opening Angles

**Option A - Operations Frame:**
"Having come up through operations yourself, you know that great hospitality is in the details. We've been looking at how the digital booking experience could better prepare guests for what awaits them..."

**Option B - Transition Frame:**
"With your move to a strategic advisory role, you're in a unique position to shape the brand's evolution without the day-to-day. We've put together some thoughts on..."

**Option C - Heritage Respect Frame:**
"What Robin and Judy built is remarkable - one of the few genuinely distinctive hotel brands in the UK. We've been studying how to honor that while refreshing the digital presence..."

### What to Avoid

- Don't critique the current brand (it's genuinely good)
- Don't position as "saving" anything
- Don't be generic or template-y
- Don't ignore his operational background by being too "creative"

## Alternative Contact: Kevin Styles (Current CEO)

If redirecting to the new CEO:

**Kevin Styles - CEO (from July 2025)**

**Background:**
- Former CEO of Honest Burgers
- Former CEO of Jamie Oliver Group
- Previous roles at Vue International, American Golf
- NED at The Pig since January 2025 before becoming CEO

**Leadership Style:**
- Emphasizes "true hospitality" and making guests feel "seen, understood and cared for"
- Business growth focused ("sustainable growth", "disrupt a sector")
- Brand-conscious ("distinctive brand")

**Approach for Styles:**
- More business-outcome focused messaging may resonate
- He's newer to the brand, potentially more open to outside perspectives
- "Setting the standard for boutique hospitality" - he values excellence
